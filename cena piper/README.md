# Web 3D Tutorial

_Blender to Web3D as fast as possible_

![Preview](/public/preview.png)

This repo is meant to accompany a tutorial series on Youtube that starts here: https://youtu.be/1BvLpt7egss

As the course advances I'll add scripts here to make some tasks easier and grow this to be a Blender to Web toolkit.
